modtools/reaction-trigger-transition
====================================

.. dfhack-tool::
    :summary: todo.
    :tags: dev


Prints useful things to the console and a file to help modders
transition from ``autoSyndrome`` to `modtools/reaction-trigger`.

This script is basically an apology for breaking backward
compatibility in June 2014, and will be removed eventually.
