.. dfhack-tool::
    :summary: Prevent infinite accumulation of roaming undead.
    :tags: untested fort auto fps gameplay units

With this tool running, all undead that have been on the map for one month
gradually decay, losing strength, speed, and toughness. After six months,
they collapse upon themselves, never to be reanimated.

In any game, this can be a welcome gameplay feature, but it is especially
useful in preventing undead cascades in the caverns, where constant combat
can lead to hundreds of undead roaming the caverns and destroying your FPS.
