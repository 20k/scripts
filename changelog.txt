This file contains changes specific to the scripts repo. See docs/changelog.txt
in the dfhack repo for a full description, or
https://docs.dfhack.org/en/latest/docs/Compile.html#build-changelog

NOTE: currently, gen_changelog.txt expects a "Future" section to exist at the
top of this file (even if no changes are listed under it), or you will get a
"Entry without section" error. Also, to maintain proper sorting in the generated
changelogs when making a new release, docs/changelog.txt in the dfhack repo must
have the new release listed in the right place, even if no changes were made in
that repo.
