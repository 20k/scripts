``modtools/*`` scripts provide tools for modders, often with changes
to the raw files, and are not intended to be called manually by end-users.

They all have standard arguments: arguments are of the form ``tool -argName1 argVal1
-argName2 argVal2``. This is equivalent to ``tool -argName2 argVal2 -argName1
argVal1``. It is not necessary to provide a value to an argument name: ``tool
-argName3`` is fine.

Argument names are preceded with a dash, and supplying the same argument
name multiple times will result in an error.

The ``-help`` argument to any ``modtools`` script will print a descriptive
usage string describing the arguments, similar to the documentation here.

For multiple word argument values, brackets must be used: ``tool
-argName4 [ sadf1 sadf2 sadf3 ]``. In order to allow passing literal braces as
part of the argument, backslashes are used: ``tool -argName4 [ \] asdf \foo ]``
sets ``argName4`` to ``\] asdf foo``. The ``*-trigger`` scripts have a similar
policy with backslashes.
